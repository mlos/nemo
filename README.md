## The Concept

Welcome to Nemo, the **ne**tworked **m**usic b**o**x. The project describes my efforts to create a homebrew UPnP renderer, with the following goals:

* Produce a simple device, to extend my already [existing][ref-tuner] [stack][ref-cdplayer] of [Technics][ref-amplifier] [gear][ref-equalizer] (no need yet for an AV Receiver)
* Give the Raspberry Pi I have lying around a home
* Brush up my electronics skills

### UPnP

[UPnP][ref-upnp] stands for Universal Plug and Play and is the technology that underpins [DLNA][ref-dlna] , which lets you stream media between devices connected in your home network, and that comes with virtually any audio or TV equipment you can buy nowadays. 

### Context
The following diagram illustrates the context in which Nemo operates. A [smartphone app][ref-app], selects a song from the music library on the [NAS][ref-nas], and instructs Nemo to reproduce it.

## The Requirements
Nemo is conceived to fulfill the following needs:

* Repurpose my [Raspberry Pi model B][ref-pi]
* Good enough audio quality, but at least better than what's [built-in][ref-pi-audio]
* The ability to gracefully power off the device (orderly shutdown of the [system software][ref-raspbian]). Although the Pi [draws relatively little power][ref-pi-power], it doesn't seem right to leave it powered on 24/7.
* Feedback about operational state (booting, playing, powering off). A user should be able to see what's going on.
* [RCA][ref-rca-jack] jack to connect it to standard stereo equipment.
* LAN connection to easily hook it up to the home network (no Wi-Fi configuration troubles)

## The Design
### Hardware
The following schematic illustrates the high level hardware design.

The following components are used:

**RPI** - Raspberry Pi 1 Model B. The core of the system.

**PWR** - 5V power supply.

**BTN_1** and **BTN_2** - Function buttons to control **DISP**

**DISP** - A [128x128 pixel OLED][ref-oled] for displaying song and artist information

**SNDC** - An [external USB sound card][ref-usb-sound], for "good enough" quality audio

**PWR_RES** - The power and reset button.

**LED_R** and **LED_G** - Red and green LEDs respectively, that are used for system feedback. A third color (orange) is also used by combining the colors. A single [RGB LED][ref-led] neatly fulfills this function.

**PMC** - The [Power Management Circuitry](PMC.md), interfaces with the **RPI** and is responsible for making sure the LEDs have the right color and enabling the **PWR_RES** button depending on the system state.
